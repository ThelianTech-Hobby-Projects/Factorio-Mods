# Thelian Industries

 You have been contracted by The Thelian Mining & Extraction Corporation to travel to nearby star systems in search for new sources of resources. 
 You land on Navuis, a small habitual exoplanet, located in the star system X-42, about 69 lightyears away from Sol-Earth. Navuis a planet scanned to be Full of rich resources, but also has signs of unknown potentially hostile fauna. 
 Your job is to setup a new industrial complex and planetary outposts to support a supply line for sending vital resources back to Earth by sending cargo rockets to your autonomous Space-Tug 9000.

## Start of a New Game
- You Start with your Space Tug 9000 in Orbit, It has been thoroughly damaged from all the asteroids that this star system is littered with. You must repair it so you can finish setting up a supply line back to earth.
- All early game minable deposits will be in starting area to simulate landing in a spot of easy accessible surface deposits.

#### Early Game Automation and Science Projects
- Setup primitive ore processing and smelting.
- Early Steam and Powerpack Automation & Crafting Phase. 
- Create an early mall to help with the production of construction parts, and research equipment.
- Research Progression Technologies and prepare for Mega base Starter and Tier 2 machines, extraction, processing, and assembling.
- Early Chemical Processing recipes for rubber from rubber trees.

#### Research Progression to Advanced Technology

- Researching Technologies for ever advancing technology for more efficient processes in crafting and ore extraction. 
- Underground Ore deposits and extraction, processing and smelting.
- More Efficient Crafting Recipes, Start Of Petroleum & Oil Chain.
- Early To Late Game Liquid Fuels for Crafting and Power Generation.
- Start of Early Rocketry Technology, Planet Exploration

#### System Exploration & Outpost Automation

- 

#### Final Preparation for Sending Packages.
