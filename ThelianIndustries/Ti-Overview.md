# Thelian Industries

 You have been contracted by The Thelian Mining & Extraction Corporation to travel to nearby star systems in search for new sources of resources. 
 You land on Navuis, a small habitual exoplanet, located in the star system X-42, about 69 lightyears away from Sol-Earth. Navuis a planet scanned to be Full of rich resources, but also has signs of unknown potentially hostile fauna. 
 Your job is to setup a new industrial complex and planetary outposts to support a supply line for sending vital resources back to Earth by sending cargo rockets to your autonomous Space-Tug 9000.

## Start of a New Game
- You Start crash-landed on Nauvis, after your Space Tug 9000 in Orbit suffered from a catastrophic reactor meltdown, It had been thoroughly damaged from all the asteroids located in this star system.
- Your objective is to re-build a new inter-stellar Space Tug 9000 and finish setting up the supply line back to earth.
- Before you can achieve your objective, you must first find a way to launch yourself back into space.
- All early game minable deposits will be in starting area to simulate landing in a spot of easy accessible surface deposits.
- Starting Gear includes
