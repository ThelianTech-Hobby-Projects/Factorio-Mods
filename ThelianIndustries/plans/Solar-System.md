###### Game Stage: 3 -  Voltaris, Tectara, 

## Voltaris

### :white_small_square: Description:

	Voltaris is a toxic and electrically charged world, haunted by the ancient remnants of the Fulgorian civilization. 
	The atmosphere, thick with toxic gases and suspended oily particles, creates an environment where the day is 
	marked by scorching heat and danger, while the night brings cold, humid conditions. The planet hums with the 
	constant buzz of ancient machinery still functioning within the crumbling ruins scattered across the landscape. 
	The android-like robots, guardians of this forgotten world, are relentless and deadly. These robots utilize magnetism 
	and electricity to attack, exhibiting behaviors that combine the aggressive territorial nature of biters with the 
	crushing force of the demolishers. Some of the ruins and vaults remain operational,manufacturing new robots to 
	replace those destroyed by the player's efforts. Voltaris experiences intense electrical storms, which can occur 
	without warning, adding an extra layer of peril to its already volatile atmosphere. The air crackles with static 
	electricity, creating an ever-present hum that permeates the planet’s surface.

## Tectara

### :white_small_square: Description:

	Tectara is a volatile and dynamic volcanic planet, almost identical to Vulcanus in terms of terrain and environment, 
	but with the added chaos of frequent and destructive natural disasters. It is a world of shifting tectonic plates, 
	endless volcanic activity, and a landscape that is constantly reshaped by catastrophic events. The planet is teeming 
	with active volcanoes, geysers of molten rock, and vast lava lakes. The atmosphere is thick with ash and smoke, making 
	visibility poor, and the air is hot and acrid. Lava rivers carve their way through the planet's surface, and the ground 
	itself is unstable, shifting and buckling under the pressure of constant tectonic movements. While there are no Demolisher-like 
	enemies on Tectara, the true threat comes from the planet’s unpredictable and often deadly natural disasters. Earthquakes and 
	volcanic eruptions occur without warning, tearing apart structures, displacing the land, and altering the landscape. These events 
	are highly destructive, leaving craters and scorched earth in their wake. However, in rare instances, the destruction uncovers 
	new and valuable ore deposits, giving players a reason to embrace the chaos, despite the risks. Building on Tectara requires 
	careful planning. New earthquake-resistant foundations can be constructed to reduce the damage to structures during seismic events. 
	These foundations help protect buildings from being destroyed, but they also have the unfortunate side effect of preventing newly 
	exposed ore deposits from forming on the tiles where they are placed. Players must weigh the pros and cons of preserving their 
	infrastructure versus the potential gain of unearthing hidden resources. Tectara is an unforgiving world where survival relies 
	on adaptability. The planet's surface is in constant flux, and the power of its seismic and volcanic activity can both be a blessing 
	and a curse. Those who dare to settle here must master the art of building resilient outposts and brace themselves for the 
	next big disaster, which could change the planet’s geography overnight.
