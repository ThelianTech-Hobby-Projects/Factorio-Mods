##### Game Stage: 3 -  Voltaris, Tectara, Pyrosauria

## Voltaris

### :white_small_square: Description: (Currently AI Generated)

	Voltaris is a toxic and electrically charged world, haunted by the ancient remnants of the Fulgorian civilization. 
	The atmosphere, thick with toxic gases and suspended oily particles, creates an environment where the day is 
	marked by scorching heat and danger, while the night brings cold, humid conditions. The planet hums with the 
	constant buzz of ancient machinery still functioning within the crumbling ruins scattered across the landscape. 
	The android-like robots, guardians of this forgotten world, are relentless and deadly. These robots utilize magnetism 
	and electricity to attack, exhibiting behaviors that combine the aggressive territorial nature of biters with the 
	crushing force of the demolishers. Some of the ruins and vaults remain operational,manufacturing new robots to 
	replace those destroyed by the player's efforts. Voltaris experiences intense electrical storms, which can occur 
	without warning, adding an extra layer of peril to its already volatile atmosphere. The air crackles with static 
	electricity, creating an ever-present hum that permeates the planet’s surface.

## Tectara

### :white_small_square: Description: (Currently AI Generated)

	Tectara is a volatile and dynamic volcanic planet, almost identical to Vulcanus in terms of terrain and environment, 
	but with the added chaos of frequent and destructive natural disasters. It is a world of shifting tectonic plates, 
	endless volcanic activity, and a landscape that is constantly reshaped by catastrophic events. The planet is teeming 
	with active volcanoes, geysers of molten rock, and vast lava lakes. The atmosphere is thick with ash and smoke, making 
	visibility poor, and the air is hot and acrid. Lava rivers carve their way through the planet's surface, and the ground 
	itself is unstable, shifting and buckling under the pressure of constant tectonic movements. While there are no Demolisher-like 
	enemies on Tectara, the true threat comes from the planet’s unpredictable and often deadly natural disasters. Earthquakes and 
	volcanic eruptions occur without warning, tearing apart structures, displacing the land, and altering the landscape. These events 
	are highly destructive, leaving craters and scorched earth in their wake. However, in rare instances, the destruction uncovers 
	new and valuable ore deposits, giving players a reason to embrace the chaos, despite the risks. Building on Tectara requires 
	careful planning. New earthquake-resistant foundations can be constructed to reduce the damage to structures during seismic events. 
	These foundations help protect buildings from being destroyed, but they also have the unfortunate side effect of preventing newly 
	exposed ore deposits from forming on the tiles where they are placed. Players must weigh the pros and cons of preserving their 
	infrastructure versus the potential gain of unearthing hidden resources. Tectara is an unforgiving world where survival relies 
	on adaptability. The planet's surface is in constant flux, and the power of its seismic and volcanic activity can both be a blessing 
	and a curse. Those who dare to settle here must master the art of building resilient outposts and brace themselves for the 
	next big disaster, which could change the planet’s geography overnight.

## Pyrosauria

### :white_small_square: Description: (Currently AI Generated)

	Pyrosauria is a chaotic world where fire and life intertwine in a violent, ever-evolving landscape. Vast lava fields and active 
	volcanoes carve through dense jungles and tropical swamps, creating a primordial environment teeming with both danger and opportunity. 
	The planet’s terrain and climate are an unpredictable fusion of volcanic destruction and lush, untamed wilderness, evoking a world straight 
	from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A newly discovered enemy faction dominates Pyrosauria, thriving in the hostile conditions. 
	Their base generation and spawning mechanics resemble those of Nauvis, allowing them to adapt to both volcanic and jungle environments. 
	The planet also features a unique pollution layer, similar to Gleba, where toxins released from industry interact with the atmosphere, 
	flora, and lava in unpredictable ways. The ever-erupting volcanoes and lava lakes provide an abundant source of stone, constantly 
	reshaping the terrain as molten rivers cool into new cliffs and plateaus. While the volatile environment makes large-scale construction 
	challenging, it also presents unparalleled opportunities for biological research, bio-warfare advancements, and harnessing the raw power 
	of the planet itself. Survival on Pyrosauria demands resilience, adaptability, and an understanding of the balance between destruction and life.

##### Game Stage: 4 -  Aquilio, Zephyrus, & *WIP*

## Zephyrus

### :white_small_square: Description: (Partially/Mostly AI Generated)

	Zephyrus is an immense gas giant, a world of crushing gravity and chaotic jet streams that rip through its dense atmosphere at 
	unimaginable speeds. Unlike any other world, it has no known solid ground, if there is any surface beneath the endless storms, no 
	explorer will ever survive long enough to find it. The pressure at lower altitudes is fatal, and the towering storms can 
	generate winds powerful enough to tear apart entire fleets of starships. Surviving on Zephyrus requires technology far beyond 
	conventional planetary colonization. The Zepherys Platform, A massive hovering airship sustained by advanced hovercraft and airship 
	technology—serves as the only possible foothold in the planet's ever-churning upper atmosphere. Positioned at a safe altitude 
	where the pressure is survivable, the platform provides the foundation for establishing gas harvesting operations. The dangers of Zephyrus 
	are endless. Gigantic storm systems can last for centuries, generating tornado-like wind gusts capable of shredding even the toughest 
	infrastructure. The swirling, multicolored clouds conceal unseen threats, including corrosive gases that eat away at machinery and 
	floating pockets of highly volatile compounds that can ignite from the smallest spark. Equipment and infrastructure must be 
	constantly maintained, repaired, or replaced as they slowly succumb to the planet’s relentless forces. Despite the hazards, Zephyrus 
	is an unparalleled source of rare and valuable gases. Harvesting and refining these gases is a monumental challenge, requiring 
	specialized shielding, adaptive filtration systems, and the fortification of the Zepherys Platform itself against the constant onslaught 
	of nature’s fury. Those who can survive Zephyrus’s wrath stand to gain immense wealth—but only if they can keep their floating empire 
	from being torn apart by the planet’s merciless winds.

###### Game Stage: 5 - Icarion's Grave, & Solar System Edge(*Win_Condition Zone*)

## Icarion's Grave

### :white_small_square: Description: (AI Generated)

	Once the planet Icarion, this orbit is now home to a vast and perilous asteroid field "the shattered remnants" of a world long destroyed 
	by an unknown cataclysm. Massive asteroids drift through the void, creating an ever-present hazard for any who dare to navigate these 
	treacherous depths. Preliminary scans reveal asteroids rich in valuable metals, ice, and other exotic materials, making this field a 
	high-risk, high-reward venture for those willing to establish operations.At the heart of Icarion’s Grave lies its most coveted resource 
	Promethium crystals, a rare and radioactive element with exotic properties vital for the creation of FTL/Warp-Drive technology. Its unique 
	crystalline structure resembles a long, thin hexagonal prism, capped by hexagonal pyramids on both ends, with three torus-like rings evenly 
	spaced along the main body. However, resource extraction here is no simple task. The unpredictable movements of colossal asteroids pose a 
	constant threat, requiring vigilant defenses and careful base planning to ensure survival. Establishing a stable mining operation within 
	this chaotic expanse is not just a challenge, it’s a necessity for those who seek to harness the power of Promethium crystals.
