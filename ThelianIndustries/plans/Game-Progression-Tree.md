## :pushpin: Game Stage 1:
### :small_blue_diamond: Nauvis, Nauvis Orbit & Luna
- You will start with some starting gear, and some emergency supplies. I have overhauled the starting progression to use new battery powered equipment, and provides starter solar gear for initial power network and a battery charger to charge batteries.
- Starting Gear: 3x Re-Charge Mining-Drills, 6x Re-Charge Inserters 20x LumaCell Batteries, 1x Battery Charger, 1x Solar Panel, 1x Pair of Jumper Cables. 1x Re-Charge Ore Scanner, 1x Re-Ore Crusher, 1x Re-Charge Ore Sorter. (Check if possible for some prefered mechanics)
- Starting Resource patches are visible, small size and regular richness. looking at roughly 25k to 100k total yield for starting patches. 
- Starting resources: Bituminous Ore, Cuprite Ore, Casserite Ore, Galena Ore, Hematite Ore, Wood from trees, Clay from Dirt Mounds.
- Stage Goals: 
  	- Rocket Silo, and Space Platform.
	- Nauvis Orbit, and Luna.
	- Prep for Stage 2.
- Nauvis:
	- Changed and Overhauled Nauvis to have a new ages: Bronze, Iron, Early Electronics Ages. 
	- Copper and Tin are the main metals used in the Bronze Age, and Iron is the main metal used in the Iron Age.
	- Early Electronics Age is the age where you will start to use electronics, and will be used for the rest of the game.
		- Uses New Electronics Chain, and new Electronics Components.
		- New Electronics Chain: 
			- Uses Copper, Tin, Lead and Wood/Stone to create new electronics components.
			- New Electronics Components: Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Diodes, Integrated Circuits, and Circuit Boards.
			- New Electronics Machines: Electronics Assembler.
	- OverHauled Crafting Chains:
		- New Mining Chains, and new Mining Machinery.
		- New Ore Processing Chains, and new Smelting Chains
		- New Intermediate Products:
			- Lots of New Parts and Components.
			- New Materials: Byproducts, and Waste Products.
			- New Metals and Alloys.
	- Buildings are now "Built" using a new Crafting Chain, and new Construction Materials.
		- Different Buildings have different requirements for construction parts. 
			- Mechanical Parts, Hydraulic Parts, Construction Parts (Bundles of different parts)
