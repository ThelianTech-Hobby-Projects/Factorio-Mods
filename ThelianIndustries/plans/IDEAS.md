# Idea's and Concepts to ponder about
---
- New modules and names: Overclocking, Efficiency, and have Productivity Integrated into machine tiers or quality tiers. (Mostly Post Space Age)
- Overhauling names to be more realistic. 
- Look into the creation of multi outputs and additional progress bars for said outputs.
- All basic and advanced electric Crafting and Smelting machinery can be crafted from a new set of universal construction materials for compact inventory usage
- Early game burner and steam phase crafting is scalable to mid game by use of steam temperature. 
- Early game water pump using burner power. can also use same idea for creating early game saltwater to water extraction using boiling technology. 
- Overhaul Belt logistics. To have 2 types of belts. Loose material belt and Regular Conveyor belts. Each have restrictions on what type of items can be transported on them
- Add new loaders (Better looking inserters) to be used for inline belt loading of machines. And remove current inserter entities, replace with 2 different types? New Loaders will have circuit network capabilities, filters.
- Super Heaters, Uses a less effective boiler to hear water to a lower temp steam. Then charges steam to high temp.
- New Research Labs, and Research Computer/SuperComputer, New Research Data Hard Drives. Primitive Research Desk (Desk with a vintage typwriter on it)
- New 1x1 Belt Splitters, dynamically connects using belt directions, will have circuit network capabilities, filters.
- Revamp Planetary Distances and Travel Speeds to Simulate more realistic values.
- Add New Planet Types: Oceanic, Terrestrial, Gas Giants, Icy.
- Gas Giant: use a new type of platform that must be kept aloft in the atmoshere, uses new helium/hydrogen and hovercraft technologies.
- Additional Fulgora Content, new enemies, new planet called Voltaris, Tech-Gating advanced Logistics behind this.
- New Prototype Robotics for early automated Construction Robots Technology. Logistical Robots Locked behind Voltaris
