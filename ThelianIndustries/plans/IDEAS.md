# Idea's and Concepts to ponder about
---
- #### Before getting to deep into development, maybe we should think about breaking up Ti into sub-mods similar to bobs mods. 
- ##### Possibly Spilt some Mod/pack Content into Planetary Expansion Packs. etc.
- New modules and names: Overclocking, Machine Efficiency, Crafting Efficiency(Productivity Module), Aromatic Therapy, Precision, & Craftmanship.
- New Module crafting chain.(similar to Bobs Mods)
- Overhauling names to be more realistic. 
- Look into the creation of multi outputs and additional progress bars for said outputs.
- All basic and advanced electric Crafting and Smelting machinery can be crafted from a new set of universal construction materials for compact inventory usage
- Early game burner and steam phase crafting is scalable to mid game by use of steam temperature. 
- Early game water pump using burner power. can also use same idea for creating early game saltwater to water extraction using boiling technology. 
- Overhaul Belt logistics. To have 2 types of belts. Loose material belt and Regular Conveyor belts. Each have restrictions on what type of items can be transported on them
- Add new loaders (Better looking inserters) to be used for inline belt loading of machines. And replaces inserter entities, replace with 2 different types? New Loaders will have circuit network capabilities, filters.
- Inserters will still have usecases on different structires, and surfaces that have no gravity, meaning space platforms and planetary orbits. 
- Super Heaters, Uses a less effective boiler to hear water to a lower temp steam. Then charges steam to high temp.
- New Research Labs, and Research Computer/SuperComputer, New Research Data Hard Drives. Primitive Research Desk (Desk with a vintage typwriter on it)
- New 1x1 Belt Splitters, dynamically connects using belt directions, will have circuit network capabilities, filters.
- Revamp Planetary Distances and Travel Speeds to Simulate more realistic values.
- Add New Planet Types?: Oceanic, Terrestrial, Gas Giants, Icy.
- Gas Giant: use a new type of platform that must be kept aloft in the atmoshere, uses new helium/hydrogen and hovercraft technologies.
- Additional Fulgora Content, new enemies, new planet called Voltaris, Tech-Gating advanced Logistics behind this.
- New Prototype Robotics for early automated Construction Robots Technology. Logistical Robots Locked behind Voltaris
- Nauvis captured biter spawners for eggs, add ability to be affected by beacons and a new effect, Aromatic Therapy. (Fancy Speed & Productivity Effect) Locked Behind Gleba Tech
- MkII Captured Biter Spanwer with integrated module slots, Aromatic Therapy modules used in crafting recipe of new MkII capture robot.
- Overhaul Effects Mechanics& system's and Intertwine Quality. all machines start with a base chance of 5% of quality at Normal quality, and Speed or Productivity only Reduces or manipulates the current percentage rate, and Quality Modules are still normalized but rebalance speed debuffing. 
- Fish now have 5 min spoil timer and need to be crafting with a fresh water filled fish bowl, spoilage time for this is 2 hours, spoilage result is a polluted water filled fish bowl.
- Fish poison you when eaten raw, need to be cooked to actually be healthy.
- New Pipe Systems, 4 new Types of pipes normal Liquid type, gas type, molten type, & special type.
- Molten Metals and Lava, can only be transported using new molten pipe system pipe type. Molten Type Pipes do not have underground pipes, and long distance transportation needs Filling Crucibles which are then transported using betls (Yes its a barrel system get over it.)
- New Gas Type pipe systems will be used when transporting gases. Toxic, corrosive, temperature, IRL properties, will be simulated by usage of the new gas pipes. 
- Special Type Pipe Networks are custom made for usage within special crafting chains, Like the new Fusion Reactor,
- Inter Platform Item/Player transportation. Lets get rid of dropping items down to the planets surface to then launch them back up to a stationary science making platform. 
- Overhaul Fluids transportation, new Fluid Cargo Rocket, and new Fluid Cargo Hub. New Molten Crucible, Fluid wagon for trains.... and more. 
- Check to see if we can customize a pipe segments max distance, allows for upgrading to higher tier pips to allow a longer pipe distance. Vanilla Defaults to like 300 blocks or something.
- Overhaul Vanilla Production Chains to be balanced inline with new systems. 
- Early Smelting Tech, produces solidified Metal Clumps and lots of slag. Ingots can only be cast from casting machines which needs molten metal from blast furnaces, some advanced chains locked behind vulcanus.
- Post Game Bonus Planet AKA The Ark, Basing this planet off of the idea of an isolated arkship(ark survival evolved idea), This ark will include features from all the vanilla planets, possibly also features from my custom planets, as the ultimate factory building challenge. 
- The Ark will have a post game science pack that will be needed to research any infinity tech past lvl 10.
- Custom Planet using a mix of Gleba and Nauvis. Will include a new enemy faction using a new pollution layer. Terrain will be a mix of Gleba, Nauvis & Volcanoes (Mild Volcanoes compared to Tectara). These Lava pools are Mineral Poor, and only useful for stone. Will Use Gleba Bacteria Chain for Minerals.
- Enemy Faction for (pyrosauria) will be Dinosaurs, and this planet will have a jurassic park theme.
- Vanilla Quality System, need to add more modifiers to entities that are not currently affected by quality. Like maybe creating Quality Rockets that are more efficient and can launch with more cargo etc. etc.
- Add Tiers to Rockets. I am thinging we have the original factorio rocket, then I am thinking 1 or 2 more tiers, im thinking spaceX's Starship, and have two types. Cargo and Fluid Cargo types. 
- For *Redacted Planet Name* (Archo-Nexus) is a Final Post game victory planet that holds the power of nanites and infinity technology. The orbit of the planet is surrounded by new robotic drones that attack your interstellar-space platform. 
- The Archo-Nexus, is a mix of all the vanilla planets and some of my custom planets, it will be extremely difficult to complete. It will directly intertwine all the different planets production chains all in one big massive final overhaul for you to create all the sciences, and the new Nanite Science.
- With Nanite science, All Infinite Techs past lvl 10 are now researchable. 
- The Archo-Nexus Orbit, new enemies can be easily defeated by using new Plasma Launchers a Fusion based warfare technology, by integrating the knowledge of bio warfare tactics, and Fusion based Technology, you can now create new types of turrets with "smart" plasma bolts that easily will take care of the largest of enemies you will be faced with in orbit.
- Overhaul Fulgora to be waste and recycling based production and science pack chain, and lock electromagnetic science behind Voltaris.
- Pyrosauria production and science pack chain is based off of advanced bio-chemical sciences, and the manipulation of biology using pheremones etc. also includes a new bio weapons technology chain.
- Tectara production and science pack chain is based off of Titanium and Cobalt Metals for use in preparing for advanced Interstellar Space platforms/ships.
- Voltaris prodution and science pack chain is now the electromagnetic science chain. and using neodynium metals.
- Zephyrus production and science pack chain is for the efficient crafting of chemistry chains, and the production of fusion based technologies. and now is a requirement along with Aquilio for unlocking Fusion Technology.
- Fusion & Bio-Warfare based weapons technology, uses promethium shards, electromagnetics, and gathered recycled debris from those nanite infused defence drones in Archo-Nexus Orbit.
