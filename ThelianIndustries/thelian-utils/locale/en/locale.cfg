[mod-setting-description]
    #Swimming
	Swimming-speed=The speed at which you can swim in shallow water. A lower number makes you slower.
	Swimming-deep-speed=The speed at which you can swim in deep water. A lower number makes you slower.
	Swimming-is-deep-swimmable=This determines if this mod is going to change the behavior of deep water as well.
	#Waterfill
	Waterfill-enable-waterfill=This enables a standard water variant.
  	Waterfill-enable-deepwaterfill=This enables a deep water variant.
  	Waterfill-enable-shallowwaterfill=This enables a shallow water variant.
  	Waterfill-enable-mudwaterfill=This enables a muddy water variant.
	Waterfill-require-research=If this is enabled the recipes for waterfill will require research to be unlocked.
	Waterfill-recipe-difficulty=The difficulty of the crafting recipe and research.\n\nEasy: 1000 water\nNormal: 1000 water, 1 Explosives\nHard: 1000 water, 10 Explosives, 1 Processing unit.
	Waterfill-waterfillable=Detirmines what entities can be destroyed by waterfill.\n\nNone: No entities of any kind.\nGenerated: Only naturally generated entities (except biter entities).\nGenerated & Biters: All generated entites including biters and their nests.\nEverything: No limits at all.
	Waterfill-items-per-craft=How many items you will receive per crafting operation.
	Waterfill-time-per-craft=How much time is needed per crafting operation (A larger number is a slower craft).
	Waterfill-reach-increase-while-holding-waterfill=If enabled this will increase your reach distance while you are holding waterfill to make it a bit easier to place and a little bit less prone to killing you by placing it below you.
	Waterfill-reach-with-waterfill=The amount of tiles the reach distance will be increased while holding waterfill.
	Waterfill-water-per-deepwater=When this value is larger than 1 this setting will override the deep water recipe to require the specified amount of normal waterfill as ingredient.
	Waterfill-waterfill-recipe-override=This setting allows you to completely override the recipe for waterfill.\n\n!!! WARNING !!!\n\nA mistake in this setting can cause unexpected problems so make sure you have it correct!\nMake a backup of your `mod-settings.dat` file prior to modifying this setting.\n\nThe format is as follows: type:item=amount\nYou can add more that one by seperating multiple of these entries by a comma.\n\nExample: fluid:water=1000,item:explosives=10,item:processing-unit=1\nThis would be the same as hard recipe difficulty.
	Waterfill-deepwaterfill-recipe-override=This setting allows you to completely override the recipe for deep waterfill.\n\n!!!
