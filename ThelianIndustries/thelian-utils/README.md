# _Thelian's Utils_

This is a mod of utilities and QoL features that I deem useful for my modpack and should be in the game in general.

## List of Features:

    A. Ability to Swim in shallow and/or Deep water. Waterfill similar to landfill but for water.
    B.

[Noxy's Swimming](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/CobaltSky/Noxys_Swimming),
[Noxy's Waterfill](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/CobaltSky/Noxys_Waterfill) Both use The Unlisence Lisence so directly implemented their code with a few changes.
